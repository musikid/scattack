# Introduction

Network attacks are a major concern in our world growingly connected.
As evidenced by the attacks of SolarWinds (@SolarWinds),
which involved the compromise of the SolarWinds Orion platform
through a stolen virtual private network (VPN) account,
or GitHub (@GitHubDDoS) DDoS attack, relying on the use of a memcached amplification attack,
the nature of network assaults is as diverse as their consequences.

To defend from such breaches, it is necessary to understand
and be able to reproduce those attacks in a controlled environment.
Depending on their nature, implementating them require different tools and techniques,
from network sniffing to packet crafting.

In this context, the Scapy library is a powerful tool to perform network analysis and penetration testing.

## Scapy

Scapy is a packet manipulation library for Python,
which allows to forge or decode packets of a wide number of protocols,
send them on the wire, capture them, match requests and replies,
and much more.
It has been written by Philippe Biondi and the Scapy community in 2003,
as a way to perform network analysis and penetration testing in a simple and efficient way,
without the need to write complex scripts or programs.
It features a simple and extensive API, is able to run on a fairly wide range of platforms,
and is open-source, which makes it a very attractive tool for professionals and hobbyists alike.
Its ability to craft packets on the fly for a wide range of protocols makes it very versatile.
Our goal is to demonstrate the usage of those features to perform several network attacks.

# Attacks

To demonstrate the capabilities of the Scapy library,
three network attacks,
differing in their nature and implementation
to better assess the capabilities of the library in multiple scenarios,
have been chosen to be implemented:

- Wi-Fi deauthentication
- ARP cache poisoning
- DHCP starvation

## Wi-Fi deauthentication

Wi-Fi deauthentication involves sending deauthentication frames to a client connected to a Wi-Fi network.
This results in the client being disconnected from the network,
and having to re-authenticate to regain access.
This can be used to disrupt the connection of legitimate clients to a Wi-Fi network,
or to force them to connect to a rogue access point controlled by the attacker.

    # Ongoing exploitation
    Note over Attacker,Client: Client disconnected from AP
```

## ARP cache poisoning

ARP cache poisoning works by sending fake Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) messages to an Ethernet LAN.
This results in the linking of the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of a legitimate computer or server on the network.
Once the attacker's MAC address is linked to an authentic IP address,
the attacker will begin receiving any data that is intended for that IP address.
This allows the attacker to intercept, modify or block the traffic.

    Target->>Attacker: ARP Reply (I have Target's IP, my MAC is A)
    Attacker->>Router: ARP Request (Who has Router's IP?)
    Router->>Attacker: ARP Reply (I have Router's IP, my MAC is B)

    # ARP Cache Poisoning phase
    Attacker->>Victim: ARP Reply (I have Router's IP, my MAC is A)
    Note over Attacker,Victim: Victim updates ARP cache with wrong MAC (A)

    # Traffic redirection phase
    Victim->>Attacker: Regular traffic (MAC address now points to Attacker)

    # Optional: Attacker forwarding traffic to real Target
    Attacker->>Target: Forwarded traffic from Victim

    # Ongoing exploitation
    Note over Attacker,Victim: Attacker intercepts/analyzes traffic
```

## DHCP starvation

DHCP starvation imply sending a large number of DHCP requests to a DHCP server,
with the aim of exhausting the pool of available IP addresses that the server can allocate.
This results in the server being unable to allocate IP addresses to legitimate clients,
which can lead to a denial of service (DoS) attack.

```{mermaid}

        Attacker->>DHCP: DHCP Discover
        DHCP->>Attacker: DHCP Offer (IP address n)
        Attacker->>DHCP: DHCP Request (I want IP address n)
        DHCP->>Attacker: DHCP Ack (IP address n)
    end

    Victim->>DHCP: DHCP Discover
    Note over DHCP,Victim: Server unable to offer IP address
```

# Project

These attacks are implemented in our project,
which consists in the development of a single platform tool
to launch said network attacks using the Scapy library.
We chose to implement it as a graphical user interface (GUI)
to provide an easy way to select the attack to perform
and input its parameters while providing validation and error handling.

### Architecture

The tool is implemented in Python,
uses the Scapy library to craft and send packets,
and the Tkinter library to provide a graphical user interface (GUI)
allowing to easily select the attack to perform
and to input the necessary parameters.

![Graphical user interface of the tool](./scattack_gui.png)

The tool is composed of two main components:

- The user interface, which allows the user to select the attack to perform and input its parameters,
  provides validation and error handling,
- The executor, which takes the parameters from the GUI and performs the attack while returning the errors and results to the GUI.

These components communicate using message passing through the Python [`Queue`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html) class,
and a set of commands and responses classes to ensure a unified communication.

## Usage of Scapy

The library provides a simple and efficient way to craft packets,
in the form of a domain-specific language (DSL) using Python syntax,
that allows for a robust and efficient definition of any type of packet.
The advantage of using Python syntax and a Python interpreter
as the DSL syntax and interpreter is threefold:
it eliminates the need for a separate interpreter,
it spares users from learning a new language,
and it provides a comprehensive, succinct, and highly capable language.

Scapy's design allows users to define a packet
or a series of packets as layers stacked on top of each other.
Each layer's fields have practical default values that can be overridden as needed.
Scapy does not impose the use of predefined methods or templates,
which removes the necessity of creating a new tool for each unique scenario.
In contrast to languages like C, where it might take an average of 60 lines to describe a packet,
Scapy can accomplish this in just one line.

For example, to craft an ARP poisoned packet:

```python
from scapy.all import Ether, ARP

# ETHER_BROADCAST is a constant defined as a bytes object,
# but could also be a string
ETHER_BROADCAST = bytes.fromhex("ffffffffffff")
ETHER_ANY = "00:00:00:00:00:00"
spoofed_mac = "00:11:22:33:44:55"
spoofed_ip = "127.0.0.1"
target_ips = ["172.0.0.2", "172.0.0.3"]


(
    Ether(dst=ETHER_BROADCAST, src=spoofed_mac) # <1>
    / ARP( # <2>
        op="is-at", # <3>
        psrc=spoofed_ip,
        pdst=target_ips, # <4>
        hwdst=ETHER_ANY,
        hwsrc=spoofed_mac,
    )
)
```
1. Create an Ethernet frame with the destination MAC address set to the broadcast address and the source MAC address set to the attacker's MAC address.
2. Add an ARP layer to the frame using the `/` operator to stack the layers.
3. Set the ARP operation to "is-at" (response) with a string value, which could also be set to 2.
4. We use a list to illustrate that multiple IP addresses can be targeted and for each a different packet will be generated.

Using these crafting capabilities, we implemented the attacks in our tool.

#### Wi-Fi deauthentication

This attack is very different from the others, as it targets a lower layer of the OSI model
which is the data link layer, and more specifically the 802.11 standard for wireless networks.
Network attacks at this level are more complex to implement and require a wireless network interface card (NIC) in monitor mode.
The attack is performed by sending deauthentication frames to the targeted client,
which will result in the client being disconnected from the network.
The AP BSSID is spoofed to make the client believe that the deauthentication frame comes from the AP.

In terms of Scapy, the deauthentication frame is crafted as follows:

```python
from scapy.all import Dot11, Dot11Deauth, RadioTap

# Create a deauthentication frame
(
    RadioTap() # <1>
    / Dot11( # <2>
        addr1=target_mac, # <3>
        addr2=ap_bssid, # <4>
        addr3=ap_bssid, # <4>
    )
    / Dot11Deauth(reason=7) # <5>
)
```
1. Create a RadioTap frame to allow the injection of the frame into the data link layer.
2. Add a Dot11 layer to the frame for the 802.11 standard frame format.
3. Set the destination MAC address to the client's MAC address.
4. Set the source and BSSID MAC addresses to the AP's BSSID.
5. Add a Dot11Deauth layer to the frame to send the deauthentication management frame.

These frames are then sent using the `sendp` function from Scapy.
With the user interface, the user can input the MAC address of the client to deauthenticate and the BSSID of the AP to spoof,
while ensuring that the input is valid and handling any errors.

## Results

The tool has been tested on a variety of networks and devices,

In this report, we present the development of a tool to launch network attacks using the Scapy library,
to demonstrate the use of the library to perform different network attacks,
in particular Wi-Fi deauthentication, ARP cache poisoning and DHCP starvation attacks.
